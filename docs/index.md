## Introduction

Single Sign-On (SSO) allows users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple applications without needing to log in separately to each one. This enhances user experience and improves security.

## Getting Started

To begin configuring SSO, ensure you have the necessary permissions and access to the identity provider you plan to use.

## Configuration Steps

1. **Choose an Identity Provider**: Select an identity provider that supports SSO.
2. **Register Your Application**: Follow the provider's instructions to register your application.
3. **Configure Redirect URIs**: Set up the redirect URIs as specified in the provider's documentation.
4. **Implement Authentication Logic**: Integrate the authentication logic into your application.
